# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is a web page that showcases the inner workings of various sorting algorithms. It provides an interactive environment for users to observe the sorting process and gain insights into how different algorithms perform.

## Implemented Algorithms

The Sorting Visualizer currently includes the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort

## Features

### Visualization Controls

The web page offers the following visualization controls to customize the sorting process:

- Speed Control: Users can adjust the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting algorithms at different rates. There are five speed levels available, allowing for a detailed or faster-paced visualization experience.
- Data Size Control: Users have the ability to choose the size of the data set to be sorted. This feature enables them to analyze how sorting algorithms handle different data sizes, providing a deeper understanding of their efficiency.
- Generate New Data: The application allows users to generate a new set of random data to be sorted. This feature provides the opportunity to test the sorting algorithms with various data sets and observe their performance in different scenarios.

### Time and Space Complexity

The Sorting Visualizer provides information about the time and space complexity of the currently visualized algorithm. This information is valuable for understanding the efficiency and resource requirements of each sorting algorithm. By displaying the complexity metrics, users can compare and evaluate different algorithms based on their performance characteristics.

## Getting Started

To use the Sorting Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Select a sorting algorithm from the available options.
4. Adjust the visualization controls (speed and data size) to suit your preferences.
5. Click on the "Generate New Array" button to generate a new set of data (optional).
6. Click on the sorting algorithm button to start the visualization.
7. Observe the sorting algorithm in action and gain insights into its inner workings.
8. Experiment with different algorithms, data sizes, and speeds to explore and compare their performance.
